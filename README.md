# Custom hotkeys for Windows
A lightweight AutoHotkey project that introduces a set of custom hotkeys for enhanced productivity on Windows. It provides quick and intuitive controls for window management, Discord and Spotify integration, and text utilities such as clipboard append and text comparison.

Created with AutoHotkey v2 (https://www.autohotkey.com).

-->

1. Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc` and press **Enter** to open the **Task Scheduler**.
2. In the **right-hand panel**, click **"Create Task..."**.
3. In the **General** tab:
   - Enter a **name** for the task (e.g., AutoHotkey Script).
4. Switch to the **Triggers** tab:
   - Click **"New..."**.
   - From the **Begin the task** dropdown, select **"At log on"**.
   - Click **OK**.
5. Go to the **Actions** tab:
   - Click **"New..."**.
   - From the **Action** dropdown, choose **"Start a program"**.
   - In the **Program/script** field, enter the **full path** to your `main.ahk` file.
   - Click **OK**.
6. *(Optional)* Adjust options in the **Conditions** and **Settings** tabs as needed.
7. Click **OK** to create the task.

From now on, the `main.ahk` script will **run automatically** at **log on**, ensuring that all hotkeys are active.

### 4. Customize the settings file

Settings are stored in the `settings.ini` file. This file contains two key items: the **preferred monitor** and the **game list**.

- To change the monitor used by the `Win + B` hotkey (for switching windows), modify the `monitorToSwitchWindowsOn` variable.
  - On systems with **3 or more monitors**, this value determines the exact monitor.
  - On **2-monitor setups**, windows switch on the **secondary** monitor.
  - On **single-monitor setups**, it defaults to the **primary** monitor.

- Add games that support **Discord's overlay** to the `gameList` section to enable proper detection and handling. List each gameâ€™s `.exe` file name **on a separate line**.
